nativeapptest

prueba NativeApp

this app was developed as a test for nativeApp by me. currently this app is running on heroku by this url:https://nativeapptest.herokuapp.com/#/ so it doesnt need to be installed on a server to be tested. despite using Jhipster as a quick start framework for java spring + angular applications, this app took arround one day and 5 hours of backEnd development and arround 3 hours for the front End.

the app uses MYSQL for the database, this is the diagram (https://ibb.co/n6N3am) and the db script https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7u9wU5R4D-5U1VzQVJVbk5YRVk/view?usp=sharing for the app. Also it uses Angular 4 for front, and Java Spring for back.

I preferred not to use any external API for ease development.

only Admin user can logIn the app, to that, the user and pass are, respectively admin/admin. it's a basic app for the test, i've been a litle bussy but im still working for perform new and better functionalities
